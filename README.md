# MOJO CRM - An AI enabled CRM system
# AI-Enhanced CRM System

This project is an AI-powered Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system designed to improve the accuracy of CRM data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models. The system provides both a frontend dashboard and a FastAPI-based backend. AI capabilities include sentiment analysis, predictive text generation, and data validation to help streamline CRM workflows.

## üîç Introduction

Traditional CRM systems rely heavily on manual data entry and rule-based systems, often resulting in inaccurate or outdated information. Our solution integrates AI to automate tasks like sentiment detection, data validation, and intelligent prediction of missing data. This leads to better decision-making, improved customer insights, and reduced manual overhead.

## üéØ Objective

To develop an AI-enabled CRM system that enhances the accuracy, reliability, and usability of customer data through:
- AI-based validation and correction of input fields.
- Sentiment analysis of customer feedback.
- Prediction of missing customer details.
- A user-friendly dashboard for visualization and model management.
